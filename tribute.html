        <div class="intro">
            <p>
            Srila Prabhupada was an Indian spiritual teacher who founded the International Society for
            Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). Also known as Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, he is
            counted among the most prominent Vedic scholars, translators, and teachers of the modern era. Credited with
            translating and commenting on over 80 volumes of the Vedas' most important sacred bhakti texts, including
            the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, he is regarded as the world’s most prominent contemporary authority
            on bhakti-yoga.</p>

        <div class="info">
            <p>Born to a family of devout Vaishnavas, he developed a deep devotion towards Lord Krishna at a young age.
                So strong was his love for the lord that at the age of five, he single-handedly organized a neighborhood
                Ratha-yatra festival to glorify Lord Jagannatha! Even while growing up, he was more interested in
                visiting temples than in playing with other children. He realized the true purpose of his life at the
                age of 26 when he first met his eternal spiritual master Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura who
                instructed him to go to the West and spread Krishna Consciousness in the English language. Even though
                it would be several years before he could finally travel to the West, once he set foot in the US, there
                was no looking back. He went on to found the International Society for Krishna Consciousness in New York
                City which is today a worldwide confederation of more than 550 centers</p>
            <h3 class="subheading">Childhood and early life</h3>
            <p>He was born as Abhay Charan, on 1 September 1896, in Calcutta, India. His parents, Sriman Gour Mohan De
                and Srimati Rajani De, were devout Vaishnavas (devotees of Vishnu).
                He became a devotee of Lord Krishna at a young age and loved to visit temples. In fact he was so devoted
                that he preferred to pray to the lord instead of playing with his friends.
                He went to the Scottish Church College where he received a European led education. He was a good student
                and graduated in 1920 with majors in English, philosophy and economics. However, he refused to take his
                diploma as a protest against the British in response to the budding Indian independence movement.
                In 1922, he first met Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, a prominent devotional scholar and the
                founder of sixty-four branches of Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic institutes). Gosvami took a liking towards the
                devout young man and asked him on their very first meeting to spread Vedic knowledge through the English
                language in the West.
                Abhay Charan became the great scholar’s pupil and several years later, his formally initiated disciple
                at Allahabad, in 1933.</p>
            <h3 class="subheading">Later Life</h3>
            <p>In 1944, he started the publication called ‘Back to Godhead’ from his home in Calcutta. The magazine,
                which aimed at spreading Krishna consciousness, was published and distributed by him single-handedly
                during the initial days. He was the magazine’s sole writer, designer, publisher, editor, copy editor and
                distributor.
                For three years he toiled to spread knowledge about the benign grace of Lord Krishna through his
                magazine and suffered several physical hardships in his quest to popularize the publication. His efforts
                were recognized by the Gaudiya Vaishnava Society in 1947 and he was awarded the title ‘Bhaktivedanta’,
                meaning "one who has realised that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the end of all knowledge”.
                A married man with a family by now, Srila Prabhupada retired from married life at the age of 54 in 1950.
                After four years, he adopted the ‘vanaprastha’ (retired) order to devote more time to his divine
                purpose.
                He then travelled to the holy city of Vrindavana where he became involved in years of deep study and
                writing. He lived a very humble life and in 1959 he renounced all his worldly ties and took the order of
                ‘sannyasa’. The same year, he began working on what would become his masterpiece: a multivolume
                translation and commentary on the 18,000-verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana).
                The next six years of his life were spent in intense Krishna bhakti. He took darshan of Madana Mohana,
                Govindaji, Gopinatha, and Radha Ramana regularly and performed intensive Krishna bhajana. During bhajana
                he received the blessings and guidance from Sri Rupa Gosvami.
                He finally got the chance to travel to the west in 1965 when he boarded a steamship bound from Calcutta
                to New York City. He was 69 at that time, but was determined to spread the Krishna consciousness to the
                people of the west.
                He founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), also known as the Hare Krishna
                movement, in 1966 in New York City. The founding of this organization launched one of the
                fastest-growing spiritual movements in the history of the world.
                Addressed as Srila Prabhupada from the late 1960s, he proceeded to inspire thousands of people, both
                Westerners and Indians, to devote their lives to Krishna consciousness. Once ISKCON was well established
                in the US, he started working towards spreading the organization’s mission to other countries.
                In spite of his advancing age he was deeply devoted to his cause and spent the 1970s travelling around
                the world establishing over a 100 Radha-Krishna temples in all the major cities of the Americas, Europe,
                Africa, India, Asia, and Australia. He also gained a huge following of disciples hailing from different
                countries and initiated a total of 5,000 sincere disciples.
                He was also a prolific writer who translated and authored several books. Over the last two decades of
                his life he translated over sixty volumes of classic Vedic scriptures into the English language. His
                books are popular all over the world and have been translated into several different languages.</p>
            <h3 class="subheading">Major works</h3>
            <p>Srila Prabhupada is best remembered as the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness
                (ISKCON) in New York City. The society which he initially struggled to establish soon became a
                fast-growing spiritual movement and today is a worldwide confederation of more than 550 centers,
                including 60 farm communities, 50 schools and 90 restaurants</p>
